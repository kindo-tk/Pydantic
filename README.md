# Pydantic Tutorials

## Overview
Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python that uses Python type annotations. It enforces type hints at runtime and provides user-friendly errors when data is invalid, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## Why Pydantic?
- **Data Validation**: Automatically validates data against defined types.
- **Type Enforcement**: Ensures that the data matches the specified types at runtime.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear and descriptive error messages for validation failures.
- **Serialization**: Easily converts models to and from JSON/dictionaries.

## Contents
This repository contains tutorials covering the following topics:

- **Why Pydantic**: Understanding the need for Pydantic over standard Python functions.
- **Field Validators**: implementing custom validation logic for individual fields.
- **Model Validators**: Validating multiple fields or the entire model at once.
- **Nested Models**: Handling complex data structures with nested Pydantic models.
- **Computed Fields**: Creating fields that are derived from other fields.
- **Serialization**: Converting Pydantic models to various formats.

## Installation
To run the tutorials, install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pydantic email-validator
```
